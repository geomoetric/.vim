# Using the Angular Commit Message Conventions:
#
#<type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
#<body>
#
#<footer>
#
# Types:
# - feat (feature)
# - fix (bug fix)
# - docs (documentation)
# - style (formatting, missing semi colons, …)
# - refactor
# - test (when adding missing tests)
# - chore (maintain)
# - post (personal, used for the posts)
# 
# Scope:
# - Anything specifying place of the commit change. 
# - For example $location, $browser, $compile, $rootScope, ngHref, ngClick, ngView, etc...
# 
# Subject:
# - use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
# - don't capitalize first letter
# - no dot (.) at the end
# 
# Body:
# - just as in use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
# - includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior
# 
# Footer:
# - All breaking changes have to be mentioned in footer with the description of the change, justification and migration notes
# - Closed bugs should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Closes" keyword.
# 
# Notes:
# - Try to use as many <sections> as possible, but for small changes like formatting, then dont worry about it.
# 
# Path example: $ git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage.txt
